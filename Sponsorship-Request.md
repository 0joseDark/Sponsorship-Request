**Subject:** Request for Technical and Financial Support â€“ Robotics Prototype for Space Exploration

**Dear Sir,**

My name is **JosÃ© Raposo**, and I am currently developing a research project in the field of **robotics applied to space exploration**, with a focus on **autonomous and modular systems** designed for extreme environments, such as the lunar or Martian surface.

The main objective is to build a **fully functional prototype based on open-source platforms**, using **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino Mega**, integrating sensors, actuators, and communication modules, with capabilities including:

- Autonomous navigation (using ultrasonic sensors and LIDAR)  
- Environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, radiation)  
- Data transmission via Wi-Fi or LoRa  
- Small object manipulation using a robotic arm

I am currently in the component acquisition phase, and to proceed with integration testing and firmware development, I am seeking **financial support of $500 USD** to acquire the necessary hardware (microcontrollers, motors, batteries, sensors, modular structures, and peripherals).

I am fully available to present detailed technical documentation, prototypes, and progress reports. All sponsors will be credited in scientific outreach materials, public reports, and presentations, with visibility on platforms such as GitHub, YouTube, and Second Life.

This support will be essential to validate the concept and lay the groundwork for future stages, including irregular terrain simulation and multi-robot cooperation.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration in supporting this innovative project.

Kind regards,  
**JosÃ© Raposo**
